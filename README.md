🎯 **I don’t just code to work — I code to create.**

I'm a developer who doesn't fit in the box. While others chase job titles, I chase mastery.  
I'm currently rebuilding myself from scratch — mastering Java Full Stack Development while exploring 3D applications and AI.

- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Core Java, JDBC, Servlet, JSP, Spring Boot (in progress)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS, React.js (coming soon), Three.js (for 3D web)
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB (basic)
- **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Git, Postman
- **Learning**: Docker, AWS, Microservices
